# Codebook for the Human Activity Recognition study tidy data set

## Variables
##### 1. id: Subject ID in numeric format
##### 2. activity: Name of activity performed during the experiment
- Walking
- Walking upstairs
- Walking downstairs
- Sitting
- Standing
- Laying 

##### 3. domain: signal domain
- frequency
- time

##### 4. sensor: source of signal
- BodyAcc (Accelerometer - body component)
- GravityAcc (Accelerometer - gravity component)
- BodyGyro (Gyroscope)

##### 5. signal: type of signal
- XYZ (3-axial signals)
- Jerk
- Mag (magnitude of signals)
- JerkMag (magnitude of jerk signals)

##### 6. meanAvg: average of mean value of sample measurements per subject by activity. For 3-axial signals, the mean value is the average of the means of X, Y and Z directional sample measures.
##### 7. stdAvg: average of standard deviation value of sample measurements per subject by activity. For 3-axial signals, the mean value is the average of the standard deviations of X, Y and Z directional sample measures.
